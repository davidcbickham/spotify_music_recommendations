    "In 2019, Spotify reached a major milestone of having more than 100MM paid [Spotify Premium users](https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/29/spotify-has-100-million-premium-users/). In fact, the number of paid subscribers grew by an impressive 32% YoY. Including free subscribers, Spotify now has a total of 217 million monthly active users worldwide. Key to this growth has been Spotify's curated playlists and personalized music recommendations. Personally, I've found that Spotify's recommendations via the Discover Weekly playlist have been essential to shaping my music taste over the past 2 years. As my preferences have evolved, so have my recommendations, as they've both adpated to my new direction while still allowing for discovery of new genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to leverage publicly available Spotify song data to build a recommendation engine that could be used to extend a user playlist or a Spotify curated playlist. While Spoitfy makes an array of track/artist meta data available via their API, this recommendation engine will focus on leveraging artist meta data, associated artist genres, track meta data, and the audio features of a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the immediate business use-case is specific music recommendations, the broader application of this analysis could be applied to any item-based recommendation engine (i.e. product recommendations on an e-commerce site).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a secondary deliverable, I'd like to develop a web application within Slack that would take a user_id, playlist, discover/popular preference, and provide a list of recommended songs."

Spot checking a few artist our recommendations seem to make a lot of sense. Example for a Kanye West track below:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Clustering using HDBSCAN seems to provide some promising results. When assessing the playlist make-up of the largest clusters we certainly see that the tracks have a consistent themes such as country, peaceful songs, and chill/lo-fi music. In fact, the cluster algoirthm may benefit from a reduced number of clusters as there are currently 1.6k unique clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other Recommendation Considerations:\n",

    "    - Recommendations based on most played tracks or most popular can serve as a good baseline to gauge the performance of other more complex recommender systems\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Metrics to evaluate performance will defer depending on the business application. In the context of music recommendations, evaluation metrics might include avg. listening time of recommended songs. In the context of an e-commerce site, evaluation metric might be avg. incremental transactions. Evaluation metrics should identified prior to building the recommender\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Balancing the ability to recommmend tracks we're confident the user will enjoy based on previous listening habits with the discovery of new music that may be outside their listeing habits is key. Introducing some randomness can lead to more discovery and greater engagement in the long run"
